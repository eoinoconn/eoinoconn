Replace image1.jpg, image2.jpg, image3.jpg, and image4.jpg with the URLs or relative paths to your own images. Adjust the width attribute as needed to control the size of the images. The padding-right and padding-left styles create spacing between the columns, and the margin-top style adds some vertical spacing between the rows.
